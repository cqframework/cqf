# CQF Common

This implementation guide contains common FHIR assets for use in Clinical Quality Framework content IGs, including the FHIRHelpers and FHIR-ModelInfo libraries.

The [Clinical Quality Framework](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CQIWC/Clinical+Quality+Framework) is a joint effort of the Clinical Decision Support and Clinical Quality Information Work Groups of Health Level 7 International to identify, develop, and harmonize standards that promote integration and reuse between Clinical Decision Support (CDS) and Clinical Quality Measurement (CQM).


The continuous integration build of this implementation guide is available here:
